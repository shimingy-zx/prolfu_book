这是一群儿童项目碰撞的摇篮。

这里除了编程，还有一系列能力的锻炼。包括但是不局限于锻炼基本的搜索能力，沟通能力，领导力等等等，在做中学中螺旋式掌握做项目的基本能力。为诚意正心后进一步的修身做准备。


"This is a cradle for a group of children's project collisions."


This club offers more than just programming; it provides a range of skill development opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, honing fundamental search skills, enhancing communication abilities, nurturing leadership qualities, and more. Through hands-on experiences, members progressively master the essential skills needed for project execution. This prepares children for further personal development as they aspire to excel in their future endeavors.
